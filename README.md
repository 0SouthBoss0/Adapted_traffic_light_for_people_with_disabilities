# Adapted traffic light for people with disabilities

**Description:** a universal device that allows improving modern traffic lights and adapting them for people with disabilities. The main feature of the project is the simplicity of operation and assembly, flexibility and convenience of the program code.

**Purpose:** to create an improved traffic light and its programming based on the Arduino microcontroller.

**The main idea:** the device was created to improve the operation of traffic lights on the roads. Using the buttons or the NFC scanner, you can turn on the desired mode of operation of the light signals.

In normal mode, the car traffic light is green. If the user presses the button, the green light flashes, then the yellow light is on for a while so that the cars have time to stop, after which the red light turns on. At the same time, the pedestrian traffic light turns green, giving people the opportunity to cross the road. If the user applies a social card, the same process is started, but the green light on the pedestrian traffic light is lit longer.
